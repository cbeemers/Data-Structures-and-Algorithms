Feedback: The hash table class itself was not that hard to write, however i did struggle to get my hiddens to pass
because I wasnt updating size correctly. I thought that in delete, since there was still a Node where the delete
occurred, we didnt have to decrement the size but that clearly was not right. Word frequency was troubling at first
just trying to figure out how to approach it, but once i started writing it and testing it, it wasnt that bad.
