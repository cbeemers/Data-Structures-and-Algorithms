Feedback: This project did not take as long as the last. Probably took about 10 total hours of work with the most
difficult part, for me at least, being figuring out how to use the heap and dictionary to find the most instances of x.
Percolate down gave a little bit of trouble only because i was not accounting for all the possible values of the child
nodes.
