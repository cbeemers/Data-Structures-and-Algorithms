Name: Christopher Beeman
Hours to complete project: About 3 hours
Feedback: This first project was pretty straightforward as I viewed it as practice with python more than anything.
Throughout the course of this project the main issue was familiarizing myself with the language again with the rest of
the time spent getting myself to check for every case of a given function.
